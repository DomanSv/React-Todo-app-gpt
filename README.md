# Dreamix React Todo App

To run:

```
npm i
```

then

```
npm run dev
```

# OR

run it with docker with

```
docker compose up
```

- Browser won't automatically open if using docker, you need to manually go to localhost:3000
- Also make sure port 3000 is free as it is the only exported port

# THEN

register and play around
